GPU Shark 2 is a graphics card (GPU) information utility for Windows
and Linux. It is based on the proto-engine GeeXLab (https://www.geeks3d.com/geexlab/). 

Main features of GPU Shark 2:
- GPU information and monitoring (usage, power, temperature, fan speed, etc.)
- 3D API support: OpenGL and Vulkan
- Data export to a file (in the exports/ folder) or to the clipboard.

GPU Shark is shipped in two versions: 32-bit and 64-bit.
The 64-bit version displays more information (for example: GPU monitoring
