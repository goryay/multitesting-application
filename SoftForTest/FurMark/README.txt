FurMark is a stress test utility for graphics cards (GPUs). 
It's also an OpenGL and Vulkan graphics benchmark. FurMark 
is available for Windows and Linux. It is based on the 
proto-engine GeeXLab (https://geeks3d.com/geexlab/).

At the end of a benchmark preset (P1080, P1440 or P2160), the 
score can be submitted to an online database. The scores page 
is available here: https://www.gpumagick.com/scores/

Presets:
P1080: 1920x1080 fullscreen
P1440: 2560x1440 fullscreen
P2160: 3840x2160 fullscreen

FurMark_GUI.exe is the graphical user interface that drives the 
real program: furmark.exe (command line). To get the list of 
options open a terminal in FurMark folder and type: 
furmark --help

If you have issues with FurMark_GUI.exe, you can launch _fm2-gui.exe
that is a simple GUI with essential functions.
